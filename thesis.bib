	abstract = {We present a system for the boresighting of sensors using inertial measurement devices as the basis for developing a range of dynamic real-time sensor fusion applications. The proof of concept utilizes a COTS FPGA platform for sensor fusion and real-time correction of a misaligned video sensor. We exploit a custom-designed 32-bit soft processor core and C-based design \& synthesis for rapid, platform-neutral development. Kalman filter and sensor fusion techniques established in advanced aviation systems are applied to automotive vehicles with results exceeding typical industry requirements for sensor alignment. Results of the static and the dynamic tests demonstrate that using inexpensive accelerometers mounted on (or during assembly of) a sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) fixed to a vehicle can be used to compute the misalignment of the sensor to the IMU and thus vehicle. In some cases the model predications and test results exceeded the requirements by an order of magnitude with a 3-sigma or 99\% confidence.},

	abstract = {We describe a technique for image encoding in which local operators of many scales but identical shape serve as the basis functions. The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding.},

	abstract = {SURF (Speeded up robust features) detection is used extensively in object detection, tracking and matching. However, due to its high complexity, it is usually a challenge to perform such detection in real time on a general-purpose processor. This paper proposes a parallel computing algorithm for the fast computation of SURF, which is specially designed for FPGAs. By efficiently exploiting the advantages of the architecture of an FPGA, and by appropriately handling the inherent parallelism of the SURF computation, the proposed algorithm is able to significantly reduce the computation time. Our experimental results show that, for an image with a resolution of 640x480, the processing time for computing using SURF is only 0.047 seconds on an FPGA (XC6SLX150T, 66.7 MHz), which is 13 times faster than when performed on a typical i3-3240 CPU (with a 3.4 GHz main frequency) and 249 times faster than when performed on a traditional ARM system (CortexTM-A8, 1 GHz).},

Although this may be possible using intensity images, we here use images which directly provide access to three dimensional information. The first problem that we need to solve is to find the transformation between the different views. Previous approaches either assume this transformation to be known (which is extremely difficult for a complete model), or compute it with feature matching (which is not accurate enough for integration). In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views. This is performed by minimizing a functional which does not require point-to-point matches. We give the details of the registration method and modelling procedure and illustrate them on real range images of complex objects.},

A new natural and simple, robustified extension of the popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm (Besl and McKay, 1992) is presented, called the Trimmed ICP (TrICP). The new algorithm is based on the consistent use of the least trimmed squares (LTS) approach in all phases of the operation. Convergence is proved and an efficient implementation is discussed. TrICP is fast, applicable to overlaps under 50\%, robust to erroneous measurements and shape defects, and has easy-to-set parameters. ICP is a special case of TrICP when the overlap parameter is 100\%. Results of testing the new algorithm are shown.},

These days SVD computation is being used in numerous applications, and because of its importance, different approaches for SVD hardware computation have been proposed, however, their application is limited by the inherent SVD calculation complexity making it possible to analyze up to 8 Ã— 8 matrices until now, complying certain constrains like symmetry. This paper presents a generic and novel FPGA-based hardware architecture for SVD computation on large m Ã— n matrices utilizing Hestenes approach and one-side Jacobi rotations. Four different study cases (2 Ã— 2, 8 Ã— 7, 16 Ã— 32, and 32 Ã— 127 matrices) validate the performance of the FPGA-based computation unit reaching a maximum estimation error of 3.3718\% in the SVD estimation of a large matrix.},
